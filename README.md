# OSIRIS-PWFA

DISCLAIMER: I do not claim credit for OSIRIS. OSIRIS is an open-source, fully relativistic, electro-magnetic particle in cell code for kinetic plasma physics. The code in this repository is NOT meant to be a standard example for simulations. Please refer to the official OSIRIS website here: https://osiris-code.github.io/


This repository contains preliminary OSIRIS test code that I used to study plasma wakefield acceleration.
